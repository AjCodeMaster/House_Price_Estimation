# House_Price_Estimation

The objective of this project is to explore and evaluate the most popular machine learning models
for predicting house prices, and analyze their performance on a real-world dataset of house
prices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In this project, the dataset was created through web
scraping, API, and secondary sources, and it contains housing price, number of bedrooms,
number of bathrooms, city, sqft, neighborhood, population, number of households in the
neighborhood, median income, and average housing price per neighborhood.
Eight models were evaluated in this report, including simple linear regression, PCR, LASSO
regression, decision tree, trimmed decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and a hybrid model
combining LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The RMSLE was used as the main metric for
evaluation, and after data cleaning, outlier removal, and model evaluation, the hybrid model was
found to be the best model for predicting house prices accurately.
By utilizing the predictions generated by the model, policymakers can make more informed
decisions about zoning, land use, and development policies. Additionally, businesses and
individuals can make more informed decisions related to property investment, development, and
sales
